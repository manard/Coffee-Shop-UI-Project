The coffee shop design, created with Figma, consists of 5 frames.
One frame is dedicated to facilitating login and account creation,
while another showcases the home page. The home page displays the café's product range with detailed descriptions accessible upon product selection. Additionally,
there's a section for special offers, where all promotions and discounts provided by the café are displayed.
This comprehensive design aims to provide customers with a smooth and engaging café experience.
