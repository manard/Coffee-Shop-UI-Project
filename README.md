Designed using Figma, the café layout comprises 5 frames.
The first frame facilitates login and account creation,
while the second frame showcases the home page, featuring the café's product range along with detailed descriptions accessible upon product selection.
Additionally, there's a section for special offers displaying all promotions and discounts provided by the café.
This comprehensive design ensures a smooth and engaging café experience for customers
